# OPaCk
> An Ipak and Imeta repacker for Halo: Combat Evolved Anniversary of The Master Chief Collection (Windows).

R.I.P upstream OPaCK

https://github.com/TheOnionRingToRuleThemAll/TheOnionRingToRuleThemAll

https://github.com/TheOnionRingToRuleThemAll/OPaCk

This repo is equivalent to the upstream's first commit.

### Old ReadMe
> OPaCk is currently a modder-oriented application, but it will eventually become a user-oriented program.
It is currently modder-oriented because "inplace12.ipak is shared between all maps, so it needs to be regenerated with each custom map that you use".
Consequently, inspiration was taken "from a completely different and alien community (Skyrim) where shared resource files are simply regenerated on the fly using "must-have" tools".

### Included Dependencies: 
* MCC CEA Deflate https://github.com/Dragonflare921/MCCCEADeflate
* FiresToolBox - Batch Bitmap Extractor

Recommended dependency alternatives for future developers:
* MEK https://github.com/Sigmmma/mek/
  * Can be used for batch bitmap extraction.
* Invader https://github.com/Kavawuvi/invader/
  * Same. Uses its own method for CEA deflation incompatible with Assembly.
