#OPaCk
> An Ipak and Imeta repacker for Halo: Combat Evolved Anniversary of The Master Chief Collection (Windows).

OPaCk is currently a modder-oriented application, but it will eventually become a user-oriented program.
It is currently modder-oriented because "inplace12.ipak is shared between all maps, so it needs to be regenerated with each custom map that you use".
Consequently, inspiration was taken "from a completely different and alien community (Skyrim) where shared resource files are simply regenerated on the fly using "must-have" tools".
