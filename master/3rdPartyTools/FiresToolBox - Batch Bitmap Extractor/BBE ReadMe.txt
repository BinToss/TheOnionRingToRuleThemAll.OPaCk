(From Beta readme...because im lazy :P)

The original version of the bitmap extractor was found to be quite buggy at times which is why I've done an overhaul of the error detection and reporting code in an attempt to make it more robust. Also, the limiting to extracted bitmaps or bitmaps saved in guerilla has been overcome, so you should be able to extract all custom bitmaps aswell.

P8 bump maps are still un-extractable purely because I couldn't get a DDS file of this format that I could work from (no matter what I did in photoshop it refused to make a working dds image).

(/Beta_readme_laziness)

This version does not have bitmap viewing capabilities, but if the demand is high enough I can make a bitmap viewer if need be.

This program requires the .NET 2.0 framework in order to work so get that from www.microsoft.com before use.

Big thanks to the DevIL Development team and to Marco Mastropaolo for the .NET wrapper for DevIL.
Also credit goes out to Kornman for the TagInterfaceV2.dll which made my job easier ;) .
